# Applied-ML
This a repo containing all the major applications of Machine Learning Projects done by me . Every project is sorted by category and followed by a small description.


# Computer Vision

 1. ### Finger Detection and Counting Using OpenCV
The program can detect hand from live video and through OpenCV and Convell Hull technique counts the number of fingers shown to camera.

2. YOLO Application
3. ### Number Plate Blurring using HaarCascade in OpenCV
The program can automatically detect the Russian car number plate present in the image and Apply blurring to the image.
