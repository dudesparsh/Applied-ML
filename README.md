# Applied-ML
Repository containing all the major applications of Machine Learning / Deep Learning Projects done by me . Every project is sorted by category and followed by a small description of its application features, dataset and methods used.

# Natural Language Processing ( NLP )


 1. ### Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) using Spacy
Named entity Recognition model to extract informationand classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.

2. ### Topic Modelling using Genism and NLTK
Using statistical modeling techniques for discovering the abstract “topics” that occur in a collection of documents and thus helping in automatic (unsupervised ) title / classification process. Here we used News Headlines from reputable Australian news source ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) and used LDA, Genism doc2bow for modelling purposes.
