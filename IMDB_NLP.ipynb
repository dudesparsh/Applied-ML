              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "xxbos xxmaj considering its popularity , i found this movie a huge disappointment . xxmaj maybe i was expecting too much from this film . xxmaj after all , it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s , but i could never figure out why . xxmaj the story is uninteresting . xxmaj it is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences . xxmaj my biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that i could root for , since the intended hero is an idiot . xxmaj director xxmaj chang has no sense of style , and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative . i know this is not supposed to be high art , but i found the movie boring . xxmaj definitely not the best example of this much - beloved genre . xxmaj its cult status escapes me . i recommend you to skip it .,xxbos xxmaj what a complete piece of trash . xxmaj plot notwithstanding , when a movie 's action revolves around airplanes , you 'd think the writers / producers / director ( or xxup anyone ! ) would do a little bit of homework as to at least a xxup few of the details . xxmaj the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie . xxmaj here are just a few : i 'm glad i missed the xxup sr-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the \" xxmaj air xxmaj force xxmaj one \" xxup f-117 spectacle . xxmaj commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than xxup boeing 747  likely the ( cheap ) use of some xxmaj boeing advertising / publicity footage by the director . xxmaj exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring , much less multi - million dollar aircraft xxunk wiring . xxmaj airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship 's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air , and if they did rely on an on - board supply , the canister would be far bigger than fist sized . xxmaj medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection . xxmaj those were xxmaj f-16s , xxup not xxmaj f-15s . xxmaj mach 1 + ( speed of sound ) would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff ( watch the xxunk indicator ) . \" xxmaj standard formation \" is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile , \" route \" formation is what they were flying - not the most useful formation for an intercept . \" xxmaj acquiring missile lock \" is not likely to get an airline pilot 's attention - they have no radar detection or countermeasures . \" xxmaj wait for my signal \" is not inter - flight communication for preparing to fire anything . xxmaj xxunk from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank . xxmaj yelling into a headset does not make it transmit . xxmaj magnetic headings are given as \" headings \" not \" bearings , \" and headings are between xxunk and 360 degrees ( compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground ! ) , so turning left ( not \" port \"  that 's a boat thing ) from a \" bearing \" of xxunk to 502 is just stupid . xxmaj it is in most cases impossible to just \" turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached \"  that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again . xxmaj the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely . xxmaj airplanes do n't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back , and xxunk have more than one little lever to control the multi - engine thrust . xxmaj flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension , not seconds before landing ( good way to crash ) . xxmaj wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane , simply pulling the xxunk ) ( this time a different lever in the movie ) to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed . xxmaj did i mention that those fighter aircraft were xxmaj f-16s and xxup not xxmaj f-15s ? xxmaj guess i did \n",
